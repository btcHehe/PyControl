### Parameters
* M(t) - Torque acting on satellite
* I - inertia of the satellite
* Î¸(t) - angle of the satellite relative to gravitational force which is perpendicular to planet surface

### Model building

Equations we are gonna use in model building:  
![basic equations](https://github.com/btcHehe/PyControl/blob/master/examples/satellite/img/1.png "basic equations")

Using Newton's Second Law for angular motion we can derive equations:

Assuming zero initial conditions we can derive transfer function for our object:

General state space model:

Now we can define our state space variables as (our goal is to control output voltage):

Finally we define state space model matrices as:
