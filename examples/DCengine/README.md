### Parameters
* U(t) - input voltage
* R - motor coil resistance
* L - motor coil inductance
* i(t) - current flowing in circuit
* Vemf - electromotive force acting on motor 
* Ke - motor electromotive constant
* Km - motor torque constant
* Il - load inertia (assume that shaft inertia is negligible)
* Ï‰(t) - angular velocity of engine shaft/load

### Model building

Equations we are gonna use in model building:

Using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law we can derive equations:

From mechanics we can derive torque equations:

General state space model:

Now we can define our state space variables as (our goal is to control angular velocity):

Finally we define state space model matrices as:
